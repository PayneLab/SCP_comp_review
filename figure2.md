The chromatorgrams were created using skyline.
We followed the skyline tutorial "DDA Search for MS1 Filtering" for all 5 reps of the true single-cell as described in the massive repo (MSV000087524). The defaults settings were used in each step.


Spectra used in figure 2:

XIC A:
File: D19_15um30cm_SC5
Protein: P25205
Peptide: VALLDVFR 

XIC B:
File: D19_15um30cm_SC2
Protein: P12273
Peptide: ELGICPDDAAVIPIK

XIC C:
File: D19_15um30cm_SC3
Protein: Q9Y5B9
Peptide: NEGNIFPNPEATFVK

XIC D:
File: D19_15um30cm_SC3
