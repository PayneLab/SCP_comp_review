The data analysis was performed using MetaMorpheus version 0.0.0, available at https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus.
The following search settings were used: protease = trypsin; search for truncated proteins and proteolysis products = False; maximum missed cleavages = 2; minimum peptide length = 8; maximum peptide length = 30; initiator methionine behavior = Variable; fixed modifications = Carbamidomethyl on C, Carbamidomethyl on U; variable modifications = Oxidation on M; max mods per peptide = 2; max modification isoforms = 1024; precursor mass tolerance = ±5.0000 PPM; product mass tolerance = ±20.0000 PPM; report PSM ambiguity = True. The combined search database contained 20375 non-decoy protein entries including 0 contaminant sequences. Data files were processed on a computer running Microsoft Windows 10.0.22000 with a 64-bit AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2970WX 24-Core Processor processor with 48 threads and 64GB installed RAM. 
The total time to perform the Search task on 5 spectra file(s) was 4.82 minutes.
