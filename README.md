Figures 1, 3 and 4 from the manuscript was genereated by the corresponding notebook. 

Figure 2 was created by using skyline and following the DDA Search for MS1 Filtering.

All data used is stored in the data folder, except for raw data files which exceed the size limit and have been stored on massive (MSV000087524 for single-cell data and MSV000087689 for bulk data). Figure 1 required mzmls so the files must be first downloaded into a folder named mzmls. The specific files used to generate figure 1 are Ex_Auto_J3_30umTB_2ngQC_60m_1.mzML from single-cell and OR11_20160122_PG_HeLa_CVB3_CT_A.mzML from bulk.
