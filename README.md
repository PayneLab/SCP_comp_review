Figures 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 from the manuscript was genereated by the corresponding notebook. Figure 2 were created using skyline, and the process is described in figure2.md.

All data used is stored in the data folder, except for mzmls which are too big. The mzmls used to create figure1 will be downloaded upon running the figure1 script.
